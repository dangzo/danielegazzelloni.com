      <p>
        I'm an Italian developer with a passion for <em>frontend dev</em> and JavaScript technologies, like
        <em>Vue.js</em> and <em>TypeScript</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got my first office job in 2013 and I fired myself after only 3 months: I simply couldn't work that way. Since
        then I decided to follow the path of <em>remote working</em>, forging by myself the person I am now.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Graduated in Computer Engineering in 2012</li>
        <li>Full-stack background but addicted to front-end</li>
        <li>Worked in many startup environments and small teams</li>
        <li>Built and maintained a business web/mobile app for 3 years as a single product developer</li>
        <li>Speaking fluently English, Spanish and Italian</li>
        <li>Loving cats and pandas <span class="emoji">ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I also love life so much!</p>
      <p>
        That's why when I'm not coding I'm usually <em>running</em>, <em>hiking</em>, <em>rock climbing</em>,
        <em>playing tennis</em>, <em>gaming</em>, <em>watching movies</em>, <em>cooking</em> or just
        <em>eating a lot</em>.
